1. Executive Summary
This report details the design, development, and functionality of the Multi-Template Resume Generator, a web-based application built using Python and the Streamlit framework. The project's primary objective is to provide users with an intuitive tool to create professional resumes in multiple design templates. The application emphasizes ease of use, professional aesthetics, and modern features like dynamic styling and multiple export formats (DOCX and PDF). A key design decision was to center-align all contact information across every template, ensuring a polished and professional header section that stands out to recruiters. The generator is designed to be both user-friendly for job seekers and robust in its document generation capabilities.

2. Project Objectives
The core objectives for the Multi-Template Resume Generator were:
‚Ä¢	Develop an Interactive User Interface: Create a clean, intuitive, and responsive UI using Streamlit that allows users to easily input their resume data.
‚Ä¢	Offer Multiple Professional Templates: Provide a selection of five distinct resume templates (Classic Professional, Modern Blue, Executive Green, Creative Purple, Warm Orange), each with unique color schemes, fonts, and header styles.
‚Ä¢	Standardize Professionalism: Enforce a centered alignment for all key contact information (Name, Email, Phone, Location, LinkedIn, GitHub) across all templates to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and professional appearance.
‚Ä¢	Dual-Format Export: Enable users to download their generated resume as both a Microsoft Word (.docx) document and a Portable Document Format (.pdf) file.
‚Ä¢	Dynamic Content Generation: Implement logic to correctly populate the user's data into the selected template, handling various sections like education, experience, projects, skills, and achievements.
‚Ä¢	Incorporate Modern Features: Add functionality for creating clickable hyperlinks for professional profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub) in the final documents.

3. System Architecture and Technology Stack
The application is built entirely in Python, leveraging several key libraries to achieve its functionality.
‚Ä¢	Framework:
o	Streamlit: Used as the core web application framework for creating the interactive user interface, handling user input, and managing the application state.
‚Ä¢	Document Generation:
o	python-docx: Employed for generating the Microsoft Word (.docx) files. This library provides granular control over document structure, text formatting, paragraph alignment, and the insertion of complex elements like hyperlinks and colored lines.
o	ReportLab: Used for creating the PDF (.pdf) documents. It allows for precise layout control, custom styling with ParagraphStyle, and the creation of tables and other elements needed for a well-structured resume.
‚Ä¢	Core Logic:
o	The application logic is modular, with distinct functions for handling data, generating Word documents (create_template_word_doc), and creating PDFs (create_template_pdf).
o	A dictionary (RESUME_TEMPLATES) serves as a configuration hub, storing the styling rules (color schemes, fonts, header styles) for each template, which makes the system easily extensible.

4. Core Features and Functionality
The application is packed with features designed to streamline the resume creation process.
‚Ä¢	üìù Interactive Data Entry: The main interface is divided into two columns. The left column contains input fields for all standard resume sections. Placeholders and helper text guide the user on what information to provide.
‚Ä¢	üé® Dynamic Template Selection: A sidebar allows users to switch between the five available resume templates. Selecting a template instantly updates the UI and prepares the generation logic to use the chosen style.
‚Ä¢	üìç Centered Contact Information: A key feature is the guaranteed centered alignment of the user's name and contact details. This design choice was made to provide a modern and professional look that immediately draws attention to the most critical information.
‚Ä¢	üöÄ One-Click Resume Generation: A prominent "Generate Resume" button triggers the validation of required fields and, upon success, processes the user's data.
‚Ä¢	üì• Dual-Format Download: Once a resume is generated, download buttons for both .docx and .pdf formats become available.
‚Ä¢	üîó Clickable Hyperlinks: URLs provided for LinkedIn and GitHub are automatically formatted and embedded as clickable hyperlinks in both the Word and PDF outputs.

5. Conclusion and Future Enhancements
The Multi-Template Resume Generator successfully meets all its primary objectives. It provides a powerful yet simple solution for creating high-quality, professional resumes with minimal effort. The template-driven architecture and the enforced centered alignment of contact information ensure that every resume produced is both visually appealing and effective.
Potential Future Enhancements:
‚Ä¢	AI-Powered Suggestions: Integrate a language model to provide suggestions for improving resume bullet points or summarizing job experiences.
‚Ä¢	Real-Time Preview: Develop a live preview pane that updates as the user types their information.
‚Ä¢	User Accounts: Allow users to save their resume data to their profile to edit it later.
